Description: Contains models and tools to produce short-term forecasts for
    both case and sequence notifications assuming circulation of either
    one or two variants. Tools are also provided to allow the evaluation
    of the use of sequence data for short-term forecasts in both
    real-world settings and in user generated scenarios.
